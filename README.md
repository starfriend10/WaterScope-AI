## Hugging Face Integration
The platform connects to our hosted models at:
EnvironmentalAI/WaterScopeAI â€” https://huggingface.co/EnvironmentalAI/WaterScopeAI

---

## Usage Instructions

### For Researchers
1. Open the MCQA demo interface.
2. Select from pre-loaded research questions or enter a custom query.
3. Configure options and explanation requirements.
4. Run the analysis and compare model outputs.
5. Use the results for research insights and decision support.

### For Developers
    // API Integration Example
    const result = await gradioApp.predict("/run_mcqa_comparison", {
        question: "Water sustainability research question",
        opt_a: "Option A",
        opt_b: "Option B",
        // ... additional options (opt_c, opt_d, etc.)
        generate_explanation: true
    });

## Research Applications

### Current Capabilities
- Domain-specific question answering
- Model performance comparison
- Educational demonstrations for water sustainability
- Research hypothesis testing

### Future Directions
- Expanded domain coverage (more water sub-domains)
- Additional model architectures and ensembles
- Integration with water system databases and sensor feeds
- Real-time data processing capabilities

## Model Performance
Our domain-adapted models demonstrate the following on MCQA tasks in water sustainability:

| Metric           | DA-IT Model | DA-DPO Model | Baseline |
|------------------|------------:|-------------:|---------:|
| Accuracy         | 82%         | 89%          | 65%      |
| Response Time    | 2.1 s       | 2.4 s        | 1.8 s    |
| Expert Alignment | 76%         | 92%          | 58%      |

If you'd like, I can now:
- Re-run specific wording edits you flagged as "not right" (paste the exact line you want changed), or
- Reformat this README into a single-file plain README.md (no extra code-block conversions), or
- Output the README with alternative code-fence styles if you prefer fenced-code blocks for the examples.

Tell me which option you want and I'll provide it in the same plaintext code-block format.
